            <p>Welcome to the visualization of the CPDS. Beginning over 55 years ago, data began to be recorded for many different facets of political life. A team of researchers at the University of Berne, led by Klaus Armingeon, compiled the data together from 24 different studies covering 36 different countries. As a result, one can find nearly any political statistic they wish within this group of Excel documents; the only problem being how difficult it is to read and interpret for the layperson. This project aims to simplify and visualize the complex findings of Armingeon et. al&apos;s study. Specifically, this project will compare many of the countries included in the CPDS in order to see differences in development, gender relations, voter turnout, and other variables while paying utmost attention to the historical political context of the countries to account for the disparities. Comparative political data has never before been so broadly published, so it would of course make sense that the visualization project will maintain that broad, holistic perspective.</p>
